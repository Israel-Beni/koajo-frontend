# Git Commit Message Guidelines
#
# <type>(<optional-scope>): <short imperative summary>

# Types:
# - feat: A new feature
# - fix: A bug fix
# - docs: Documentation only changes
# - style: Changes that do not affect meaning (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
# - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# - perf: A code change that improves performance
# - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
# - chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries
# - ci: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
#
